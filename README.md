pxargs
======

pxargs is a simple work queue with rudimentary load balancing using the message passing interface (mpi) facility.
It builds and executes command lines from a newline delimited list contained in FILE or from standard input. pxargs will
run the commandlines in parallel using mpi. See the manpage for more details.
